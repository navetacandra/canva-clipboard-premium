---

This browser extension aims to streamline your design workflow on Canva by enabling a direct method for transferring certain premium assets to your clipboard. This can be particularly useful when exploring design possibilities or working within specific project constraints.

### ✨ Core Functionality ✨

* **Accessing Premium Elements:** Provides a mechanism to copy elements typically designated as premium within Canva.
* **Simplified Interaction:** By hovering over a premium asset and pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `C`, you can initiate the transfer process.
* **User Feedback:** A brief notification will indicate whether the asset has been successfully copied to your clipboard.
* **Seamless Integration:** Once copied, the asset can be pasted directly into your active Canva design.
* **Targeted Operation:** The extension is specifically designed to function on the `*.canva.com` domain.
* **Focused Permissions:** Requires only the `activeTab` permission for operation on the current tab and `clipboardWrite` permission to enable the copying of assets.

### 🛠️ Usage Guide 🛠️

1.  **Installation:** Begin by downloading or copying the extension files to a local directory on your computer.
2.  **Navigate to Extension Management:** Open your browser's extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` for Chrome-based browsers).
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Locate and activate the "Developer mode" option, usually found in the top right corner of the page.
4.  **Load Unpacked Extension:** Click on the "Load unpacked" button (typically in the top left corner) and select the directory containing the extension files (`manifest.json` and `content.js`).
5.  **Operation on Canva:** Navigate to or refresh any page within the `*.canva.com` domain.
6.  **Transferring Assets:**
    * Position your mouse cursor over the premium element you wish to use. These elements are often identifiable by a crown icon 👑.
    * Press and hold the `Ctrl` and `Alt` keys simultaneously, followed by pressing the `C` key (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `C`).
    * Observe the on-screen notification that confirms the successful copying of the asset.
7.  **Integrating into Your Design:** Open your Canva design and use the standard paste command (`Ctrl` + `V` or `Cmd` + `V`) to insert the transferred asset.

### ⚠️ Important Considerations ⚠️

> 💡 **Compatibility Note:** This extension has been primarily tested on **Brave Browser**. Performance on other browsers built on the Chromium platform may vary.
>
> 🌐 **Domain Specificity:** The functionality of this extension is exclusively limited to the `*.canva.com` domain. It will not be active or perform any actions on other websites.
>
> 🔒 **Permission Rationale:** The extension requests the **`activeTab`** permission to interact with the currently active Canva tab when the shortcut is used and the **`clipboardWrite`** permission to facilitate the copying of design assets to your system clipboard. These permissions are essential for the intended functionality.
